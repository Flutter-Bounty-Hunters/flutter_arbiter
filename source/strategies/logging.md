title: Logging
description: What is logging and how do you do it in Dart?
synopsis: Debugging is a tough task. Many developers use a bunch of `print()` statements to help. But
  print statements quickly become unmanageable. Loggers give you control over log verbosity, and
  control over which logs are active at a given time.
