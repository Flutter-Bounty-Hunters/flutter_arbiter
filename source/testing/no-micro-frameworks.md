title: No Micro Frameworks
description: Learn how to write tests without adding complexity.
synopsis: After a developer writes a few hundred tests in a project, it's tempting to start generalizing
  test behavior into micro frameworks within the project. This is almost always counterproductive.
  A little test verbosity is much better than adding test complexity.
